# DecentraVault

## Project Description

DecentraVault is a cutting-edge decentralized digital asset storage and management platform built on blockchain technology. It provides users with a secure, trustless environment to store, manage, and control their digital assets through smart contracts with multi-signature security features. The platform eliminates the need for traditional centralized storage solutions by leveraging the transparency, immutability, and security of blockchain technology.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize digital asset management by providing a completely decentralized, secure, and user-controlled storage solution. We aim to empower individuals and organizations to have full sovereignty over their digital assets while maintaining the highest standards of security through cryptographic protection and multi-signature authentication. DecentraVault strives to be the leading platform for secure digital asset storage in the Web3 ecosystem.

const decentraVault = await DecentraVault.deployed();

// Create a new vault
const vaultId = await decentraVault.createVault("My Secure Vault");

// Deposit assets
await decentraVault.depositAssets(vaultId, { value: web3.utils.toWei("1", "ether") });

// Check vault balance
const vaultInfo = await decentraVault.getVaultInfo(vaultId);
console.log("Vault Balance:", vaultInfo[2]);
```
